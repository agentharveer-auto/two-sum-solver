# Two Sum Solver

This application solves the classic "Two Sum" problem from LeetCode. It provides a frontend interface for users to input an array of numbers and a target value, and the backend finds two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

## Architecture

The application consists of two main parts:

*   **Backend (Python):** Implements the `two_sum` function, which efficiently finds the two numbers that sum to the target.
*   **Frontend (HTML/JavaScript):** Provides a user interface for inputting the array and target value, and displays the result.

The frontend communicates with the backend via a simulated API endpoint.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Navigate to the repository directory:
    `cd two-sum-solver`
3.  Run the frontend (HTML file) in a web browser.

## Usage

1.  Enter a comma-separated list of numbers in the "Array" input field.
2.  Enter the target value in the "Target" input field.
3.  Click the "Find Sum" button.
4.  The result (indices of the two numbers that sum to the target) will be displayed below the button.
